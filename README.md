# Computer Graphics

Project made with WebGL technology, using the provided WebCGF library by FEUP.   
The objective was to develop a 3D scene with different types of primitives, animations, textures, lighting, a simple GUI and the ability to move the drone with keyboard controls. The drone has a user-controlled hook that allow the drone to pick up the box when in the vicinity.
